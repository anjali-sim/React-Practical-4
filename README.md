# React-Practical-4

- For this Practical, I have designed the User Interface(UI) for the User List App. 
- I have divided the webpage into four components 
  - Navigation Bar
  - User card
  - User list

## :sparkles: Functionalities:
1. I have tried to make UI as similar as possible to what was provided to me.
2. The user data list is coming from the constant file containinig object of it.
3. I have included the hover effect as well. When the user hovers on any particular data in the list, then its details will be displayed on a card.
4. I have used react-feather library to include the icons of lock and trash.
5. The website if fully responsive.
6. The dropdown of the user list can be changed.
